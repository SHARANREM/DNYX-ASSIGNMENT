1. Emmet Shortcut for HTML Boilerplate:
   Type `!` and press Enter to get a basic HTML structure with Emmet.

2. DOCTYPE in HTML:
   `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser to use HTML5 for the page, helping it display correctly.

3. Void Elements:  
   Void elements donâ€™t need closing tags, like `<img>` and `<br>`.

4. Elements vs. Attributes:  
   Elements are the building blocks (like `<p>`), while attributes add extra info (like `src` in `<img>`).

5. HTML Entities:  
   Entities are codes like `&lt;` for `<`, used to show special characters in HTML.

6. Meta Tags:  
   Meta tags provide information about the page (like character set or description) and help with SEO and browser settings.

7. Adding Images:  
   Use the `<img>` tag with `src` for the image file and `alt` for a description, like `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`.
